# Robot Simulator

This is a command-line application written in TypeScript that simulates the movement of a robot on a table. The robot can be commanded to move and rotate using a set of input commands, and the simulator prints the final position of the robot.

## Installation

To run the robot simulator, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Here are the steps to install and run the simulator:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run the command `npm start` to start the simulator.

## Usage

To use the robot simulator, follow the instructions on the screen to provide the required input values. The simulator will take the following inputs:

1. **Table Dimensions:** The width and height of the table, separated by a comma.
2. **Robot Position:** The initial position of the robot on the table, as the x and y coordinates separated by a comma, and the direction it is facing.
3. **Commands:** A sequence of commands that the robot should execute, separated by a comma.

Once the input values are provided, the simulator will execute the commands and print the final position of the robot on the table.
